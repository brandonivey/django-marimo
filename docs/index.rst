marimo: a fast framework for realtime widget rendering
======================================================
marimo is a framework for creating asynchronously loading widgets.

A marimo installation consists of three parts:

1) A page that contains marimo widgets

2) Javasctipt that manages and loads widgets in the page

3) A backend api that provides widgets with the templates and context for them to use in rendering
